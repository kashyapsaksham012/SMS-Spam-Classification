## ✨ Project Highlights

- **🔄 Data Cleaning**
  - Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and strips out irrelevant columns for a pristine dataset.

- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Visualizes class distribution and dives deep into message characteristics like length, word count, and sentence count.

- **📝 Text Preprocessing**
  - Applies tokenization, removes stopwords & punctuation, and uses stemming to normalize SMS content.

- **🛠️ Feature Engineering**
  - Extracts smart features such as message length, word count, and sentence count to boost model accuracy.

- **🤖 Model Building**
  - Trains and evaluates a variety of classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), including powerful ensemble methods (Voting, Stacking).

- **🔬 Performance Evaluation**
  - Compares models using accuracy and precision to select the best performer.

- **🌐 Deployment Ready**
  - Includes scripts to deploy your trained model as a sleek Streamlit web application.
